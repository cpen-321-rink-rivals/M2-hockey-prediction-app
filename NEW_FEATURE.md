## New Feature

**Name:** [Add languages spoken to profile]

**Short description:** [As a way to get a understanding of the existing code, I tried to implement a similar feature as the one with hobbies already implemented. This would be enable the user to select all the languagues spoken by them and in the future the app could be a social app connecting people across hobbies and languages.]

**Location and code:** [The code written for the feature spreads across a big part of the project. The path to the screen file of the new feature is: frontend/app/src/main/java/com/cpen321/usermanagement/ui/screens/ManageLanguagesSpokenScreen.kt]
